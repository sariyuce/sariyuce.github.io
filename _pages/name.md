My full name is <b>Ahmet Erdem Sarıyüce</b> and I go by <b>Erdem</b> (one of my first names, not the middle name). So I always write my name as <b>A. Erdem Sarıyüce</b> to avoid any confusion. <br><br>
Non-english letters in my lastname are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dotted_and_dotless_I">dotless i</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%9C">u with diaeresis</a>. The 'c' in my lastname is read as 'g'.<br><br>
You can pronounce <b>Erdem</b> like <a href="https://forvo.com/word/tr/erdem/">this</a> and <b>Sarıyüce</b> like <a href="https://forvo.com/word/sar%C4%B1y%C3%BCce/">this</a>. Thank you if you have read this so far.
